1b. spam recall: 0.9774
1c. spam F1 score: 0.9852
1d. ham precision: 0.9467
1e. ham recall:  0.9833
1f. ham F1 score: 0.9647

2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data
The 10% development data was selected manually. No code written to seprate out the data.
2a. spam precision: 0.9835
2b. spam recall:  0.96
2c. spam F1 score: 0.9716
2d. ham precision: 0.9074
2e. ham recall: 0.9607
2f. ham F1 score: 0.9333

3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):

  a. The first change was in the nblearn.py script during the creation of the model. I removed all the stopwords, punctuations and numericals from the corpus. This enhancement would result in the vocabulary consisting of only specific keywords that improves the performance of the classifier.

 b. Different smoothing method: K-smoothing was used in place of add one smoothing. This showed a small increase in the spam precision and recall thereby improving the performance of the classifer. 

4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
4a. spam precision: 0.9958
4b. spam recall: 0.9782
4c. spam F1 score: 0.9870
4d. ham precision: 0.9489
4e. ham recall: 0.99
4f. ham F1 score: 0.9690
